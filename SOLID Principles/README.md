# Low Level Design (LLD)

This repository is a collection of **essential LLD notes and implementations** for software engineers. Mastering LLD is crucial for interviews and for writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code in real-world projects.

It goes beyond coding ‚Äî focusing on how to think in terms of **design, structure, and best practices**.

## üöÄ How to Use This Repo

* Start with **SOLID principles** and go through violations ‚Üí solutions ‚Üí advanced combinations.
* Use examples like *Monster Method* to see how poor design leads to violations.
* Apply concepts to your own side projects to reinforce understanding.
